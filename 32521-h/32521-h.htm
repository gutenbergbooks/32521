<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>The Author, in her work with young teachers, has
frequently noted the great difficulty they seem to have
in presenting hygienic facts to little children in a manner
so attractive as to catch and hold their attention.</p>

<p>The child's mind dwells constantly in the realm of
imagination; dry facts are too prosaic to enter this
realm. The "Land of Story Books" is the most fascinating
of all lands, and therefore the Author has endeavored
to weave hygienic facts into stories that will appeal
to the child's imagination. She believes the truths of
hygienic living and habits in the stories will "creep up
on the blind side," so to speak, and impress themselves
upon the young mind.</p>

<p>The child can appreciate only those hygienic facts
which can be applied in every-day living: he has no
interest in health as an end in itself. Furthermore, that
instruction in hygiene which is given as an end in itself,
and which does not reach beyond the school-room in its
influence, is a failure. Therefore, that instruction in
hygiene which is in line with the child's interest is also
the instruction which is most effective.</p>

<p>The effort throughout has been to make scientific
truths simple and concrete, and so captivating that the
young pupil will at once find interest in them. The
early years of child-life are the most impressionable; it
is, therefore, especially important that we stress during
these years that which means more to the conservation
of life than any other one thing, viz., hygiene.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>Lessons of personal cleanliness, the necessity for
good food, fresh air and exercise are the truths which
are the underlying principles of these stories. With
these as suggestions, the teacher may easily develop
further.</p>

<p>The mother as well as the teacher will find them
helpful as she gathers her little ones around her knee at
the evening hour, in response to the request for "a
story."</p>

<p>The questions following each story, a kind of catechism,
supply more information than it was thought
best to give in the story itself.</p>

<p>The illustrations have been prepared especially for
this work and make the lessons of the story more
impressive.</p>

</div>

<h2>A WONDERFUL ENGINE</h2>


<p>We all have seen a steam engine, have we not?
There are engines that pull trains on the railroad,
and there are engines that make factories, gins,
and saw-mills work. Then there are engines that
run great ships on the water. How many know
what must be done to one of these engines before
it can do all this work? "It must have coal, or
wood, or gasoline put into it." That is right.</p>

<p>Now this coal or wood or gasoline, when it is
used in an engine to make it work, is called fuel.
Would we put rotten or green wood into the engine?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
No. We must always put in the kind of
thing that will burn best, and make the most heat
and do the most work.</p>

<p>Let us see how this wood or coal we call fuel
makes the engine work. First, we must burn the
fuel. Second, when the fuel burns, it heats the
water in the boiler. Third, the water changes
into steam, and this steam gives the engine the
power to work.</p>

<p>Now we see how an engine is made to move
and do work, such as hauling great trains of cars,
and pulling great ships across the wide ocean.
But we must remember that the engine will not
do this work unless there is a man near-by to put
the fuel into the engine.</p>

<p>I want to tell you of another engine that is
very like the steam engine. It too must have
fuel before it can run or work. It is unlike the
steam engine in as much as it grows all the time,
and it does not need to have an extra man to put
the fuel into it. You must think of your body as
an engine and remember that it needs fuel to run
it. The fuel that makes the body-engine move
and work is the food you eat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>You have learned that you must put into the
steam engine the fuel that will burn best and
make the most heat and work. The same thing
is true of your body-engine. You must put in
the fuel that will best make heat and the power
to work. Have you sometimes eaten something
which made you sick? It must have been that
that was the wrong kind of fuel for the little
body-engine. This is the reason our mothers are
so very careful in preparing our food. They
want the little engines to have the right kind of
fuel so that they will not run off the track.</p>

<p>Now what fuel must you use in your body-engine?
In the first place you must put in fuel
that will make the engine grow so that it can do
a great deal of work. This fuel you get when
you eat lean meat, eggs, milk, and many other
things.</p>

<p>If you want your engine to keep warm, you
must use fuel that will make heat. You get this
fuel by eating plenty of fats, such as nice butter
and some sweet things. Potatoes, rice and syrup
help to run your engine.</p>

<p>You need some fuel that will make you plump<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and round and healthy looking, so you must put
into your engine fruits, nuts, a little candy, and a
lot of vegetables. You need to eat things that
have color, such as: tomatoes, lettuce, greens,
and beets,&mdash;not because they look pretty, but
because they have iron in them and help to make
your engine strong.</p>

<p>You must remember that you eat food for
three reasons: to make you grow, keep warm,
and able to work. You must be careful that you
do not eat too much of any one kind of food, but
remember to eat a little of many kinds. Your
engine can use only a little of each at one time.</p>

<p>Wood is chopped into short pieces, and coal
is broken up before it will do good work in the
engine, so the fuel must be prepared before it will
suit your engine. It must be well cooked and
then chewed thoroughly before it will do its best
work in your body-engine. You should be careful
not to swallow any food until it has been
chewed as fine as it can be.</p>

<p>If you put into your engine the right amount
of food, and the right kind of well-prepared food,
you will have an engine more wonderful than any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
steam engine that ever pulled a train, or carried
a big ship across the wide ocean.</p>

<p>The engineer sees that his engine is kept clean
and bright, in order that it may run smoothly.
Since you are the engineer of your body-engine,
you must keep it neat and clean that it may
work well.</p>

</div>


<div class='center'>QUESTIONS</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. What is it that causes the big steam engine to
do its work, draw long trains, or big ships, or turn
great factory wheels?</p>

<p>2. What must happen to this fuel&mdash;wood, coal, or
gasoline&mdash;before it can make the engine do its work?</p>

<p>3. Did you ever wonder why it is that your body
is always warm? It is very much like the engine.</p>

<p>4. What do you call this fuel that your body-engine
uses? Just as the fuel for the steam engine must be burned
if it is to make heat, even so must the food be burned
in your body if it is to keep it warm and able to work.
Of course the food in your body does not burn exactly
as the wood and coal burn in the steam engine. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
burns much more slowly&mdash;so slowly that you would
not know that it burns at all if it were not that it always
keeps your body warm.</p>

<p>Just as the steam engine needs the fuel if it is to
do its work well, your body needs the best of food if it
is to be healthy and do the best work. You have
learned that all foods do not serve the same purpose
equally well. For instance, some foods such as lean
meat, eggs, and milk build up more muscle than other
foods do; while others, such as fats, syrup, sugar and
potatoes, give more heat than other foods.</p>

<p>5. What do all colored vegetables contain?</p>

<p>6. What kinds of foods do people living in the very
cold climates need a great deal of?</p>

<p>7. What kinds of foods do people living in very
warm climates need a great deal of?</p></div>

<h2>TWO LITTLE PLANTS</h2>


<p>Look at this lovely little plant with its pretty
bright leaves and beautiful pink blossoms. Well
may we ask what makes the little plant so healthy,
strong, and pretty. It is a delight to the eye.</p>

<p>Now here is another little plant. It belongs
to the same family. The same kind of seed was
planted, and when its tiny leaves began to peep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
above the ground, it seemed to have as good a
chance as its little sister plant. But the leaves
are pale and drooping; they look sick. It has no
pretty blossoms. Its stems are withered and weak;
it can hardly hold its little leaves up. "Poor little
sickly looking plant," its strong and rosy little
sister seems to say.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i-005.png" width="400" height="221" alt="Two plants" title="" />
</div>

<p>Let us see if we can find a reason for the
difference between the two plants. I do not believe
that it will take us long to find the cause of
the sickness, for it is sick just like a little child.</p>

<p>Mother Nature prepares a special food for all
her children, food for the little plant children as
well as for the little babies in our homes, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
food for the little piggies and the frisky little
calves out in the barn.</p>

<p>When mother feeds little baby brother she
gives him nice warm, sweet milk, because that is
the food that he needs to make him grow big and
strong. Mother Nature knows that the little
babies and the little calves and pigs need this fresh
warm milk, so she prepares it all ready for them.</p>

<p>When we plant seed in the ground, the soft,
warm dark earth furnishes food for the little seed,
until its leaves and stems are above the ground.
Its little roots run down into the moist, mellow soil
and drink up the food Mother Nature has there
for it. The warm sun shines down on the little
plant and makes it green, and the pure air helps to
make its stems strong and sturdy that it may hold
its leaves and blossoms up for the passersby to enjoy.</p>

<p>What a beautiful sight it is as it seems to nod
a morning greeting of cheer and good health.</p>

<p>Now the little plant with the pretty bright
leaves and wonderful pink blossoms has had all
the water and mellow soil and warm sunshine it
needed to make it grow, from a tiny plant into
the large handsome one we see.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>The little sister plant with its sick, pale leaves
and no blossoms has not been treated kindly.
When it was just a baby plant it did not have
enough water to drink. The soil in which it
was planted was poor, and did not have enough
food to feed the tiny baby plant. The poor little
plant was shut away from the bright sunshine and
the clean, fresh air. Now its leaves hang down as
if it were saying, "I am so sick; give me some
water to drink, give me some food to make my
stems strong, give me some sunshine and fresh air
to warm me and make the nice green color
come into my leaves!"</p>

<p>We may give the little plant all that it asks
for, and help it a great deal. In a few days the
color will begin to come into its leaves and its
stems will look stronger, but we doubt if the little
neglected plant will ever become as strong as the
little sister plant which has had all the good soil,
water, air and sunshine that it needed when it
was a baby plant.</p>

<p>Little boys and girls need things to make them
strong just as the little plants do. They need simple,
pure food to make strong bone and muscle,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
pure water to drink, and to bathe their bodies
with; fresh air to breathe; and sunshine to give
color to their cheeks and sparkle to their eyes.
If the little folks do not have the things that
Mother Nature intended for them, they will grow
thin and twisted like the little sick plant. Their
cheeks will grow pale and their eyes will look
dull and heavy and lose their sparkle. They will
not want to romp and play as all healthy children
do. They will not want to go to school.</p>

<p>Little children who are ruddy and strong like
the first little plant have mothers who see that
they get all the food they need and plenty of pure
water to drink; that they keep their bodies clean
and play in the sunshine and breathe fresh air.</p>

<p>These little girls and boys are in all the games.
They love to run and play. They will grow into
strong men and women and be ready to do the
work for which they were created.</p>

<p>If the little green plant is shut away in the
dark, out of the sunshine and fresh air, it will soon
droop and die. Children are human plants and
need the same care and treatment that should be
given other plants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE STORY OF A FLY</h2>


<p>I was hatched one sunny day in May in the
nicest, warmest, dirtiest spot you ever saw. It
was in a barnyard heap, just outside a city, that
I first saw the light. I was not very old before I
had to take care of myself, so you may know I
was glad that I had opened my eyes for the first
time in such a dirty place, because it is much
easier for a baby fly to take care of himself in a
dirty place than in a clean one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>My good mother knew this when she flew
away that May morning and left the tiny egg,
from which I came, to Dame Nature to care for.
Mother Fly knew that warmth, dirt, and moisture
were all that a baby fly needed in its infant days.
She knew that the dump-heap at the barn made
the nicest kind of cradle for her baby, and
it was rent-free to all the mother flies in the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>Day by day, I grew and soon began to take
notice of things around me. It was not long
before I saw that some of the other baby flies
which were in the dump-heap with me had grown
some beautiful gauzy wings. On these wings they
began making daily visits from our fly-nursery to
a near-by farm-house. When they came back
from these visits, they would talk long and loud
about the good time they had, and the nice things
they had to eat in the great world outside the
dump-heap.</p>

<p>I was mighty glad that my wings were growing
stronger each day. One morning, bright and
early, I sailed away on my beautiful wings to see
if all the wonderful things my little fly friends had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
told me were true. I followed the lead of my
friends, and we soon came to that same farm-house.
First, we went to a door&mdash;a screen they
called it&mdash;and tried hard to get through. To our
great disappointment, we could not get through;
the screen was closed tight. One little fly said,
"I will find a way in, I don't believe the folks
who live here have been so careful with the
kitchen door." So we flew away, and sure enough
the kitchen screen door was standing ajar, with
just enough of a crack in it for a busy little fly to
slip through into the kitchen. I was next to the
last one to get through; and, alas! when I did
get in, you never saw such a disappointed little
fly in your life. Everything looked very clean,
too clean for me to enjoy it. Presently, one of
my friends called to me and O joy! he had found
some soiled dishes and bits of food on a table, just
the thing for a tired, hungry little fly. The sugar
bowl was uncovered, and, oh, how I did eat, for
I dote on nice, sweet sugar.</p>

<p>The pantry door stood ajar, and I could see
some nice things to eat in there also. After we
had feasted on the good things in the kitchen, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
flew into the dining-room. There on the table
was a pitcher filled with milk. I jumped into the
pitcher and took a nice bath and a good swim.
I came out very much refreshed, for I had left
there in the milk pitcher all the dirt I had gathered
on my feet and body in my early life. I
walked much better. I walked all over the food
which was on the table and I also walked on the
baby's bottle which was on a nearby shelf.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i-006.png" width="400" height="184" alt="Fly on baby" title="" />
</div>

<p>While I was thinking what I would do next,
a lady came into the room. She had a dear little
baby in her arms. You know how I love little
babies. I love to tickle their noses and to lick
the sweets from their juicy little mouths. I sat
and watched the little fellow, awaiting my chance
to make his acquaintance. Presently the lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
gave the baby some milk to drink from the pitcher
in which I had had such a nice bath. After the
little fellow was fed, the lady put him to sleep and
laid him in his crib in the next room for his morning
nap. My friends told me to come with them
into this room, the nursery. The lady had forgotten
to put a net over the little fellow; so I crawled
around and ate some sugar from his lips. It tasted
so good that I crawled almost into his mouth.</p>

<p>Since that happy morning, I have spent almost
every day between the farm-house and out-houses.
I have my daily bath in the milk pitcher and my
dinner from the nice juicy food on the table. Very
often I get my lunch of sweets from the corners
of the baby's mouth, and I like this best of all.</p>

<p>For several days I have felt lonely. I noticed
that the baby did not come to the dining-room to
get his milk and sugar. I kept wondering why
he did not come, and finally I wandered into the
nursery to see for myself. What do you think?
The baby was lying in his crib all red and hot.
While his mother was busy, I crawled on his
mouth to see if there was any sugar in the corners
for a lunch. Then away I flew.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>This morning I flew over to the farm-house
again, through the kitchen door, and into the
nursery. I thought I would find a glass of milk
and have a nice bath and my breakfast. But,
alas! the baby was not in his crib. The room
was so still and cold it frightened me and I flew
out. I saw several strange men and women;
the women were all crying and the men looked
sad. A man was fastening something white on
the front door. I tried to understand it all, but I
could not catch any word except "<span class="smcap">Typhoid</span>." I
wonder what that means, anyhow? As no one
will tell me, I must be off to the next farm-house
to hunt a good dinner.</p>

<p>This was a sensible fly, do you not think so,
children? Thousands of other flies might tell the
same story if we would only watch their habits
and listen to what they have to say.</p>


<div class='center'>QUESTIONS</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. I wonder if any of you can guess what was the
matter with the baby on the morning the fly found it
red and hot?</p>

<p>2. What had happened when the fly went back
to it?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>3. What caused the baby to have typhoid fever?</p>

<p>4. What is a germ?</p>

<p>5. Where did the little fly say he was hatched? It
is in such places as this&mdash;in stables and other filthy
places&mdash;that all flies are hatched and raised. They all
like good things to eat. Flies can smell a good thing to
eat a long way off; so they soon find their way to the
kitchen and dining-room. On their way to the kitchen,
they often stop by the out-houses and gather on their
feet and legs a lot of dirt and germs. I must tell you
now that the fly can get the typhoid germ or plant only
from human filth.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot2"><p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;The teacher should have an inexpensive microscope and show
the children a fly,&mdash;its head and its feet especially.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>6. Have you ever seen a fly under a magnifying
glass? On the bottom of the fly's feet are little glue-like
pads and a number of little hairs on his body and feet, to
which germs and bits of dirt stick. The fly in this story
had come to the farm-house for the first time, you know,
when he found the pitcher of milk and had such a nice
bath. He had been gathering germs and dirt on his feet,
both from his early home in the barn-yard and from the
out-house at which he stopped on his way. Some of
these germs gathered at the out-house had come from
some person who had typhoid fever. As he crawled
over the baby's bottle and its little mouth, he left
some of the germs there and he left some in the milk
pitcher also. It was careless of the mother to give her
baby milk that was not covered. The mother did not
know she was giving the baby milk in which there were
these little plants, or germs, which cause typhoid fever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>You have learned that the house-fly carries the seed,
or germs, of typhoid. These germs, or seed, will grow
and multiply in the body. So you should never leave
food uncovered where a fly can get to it.</p>

<p>7. Since you know where house-flies are hatched and
bred, what may you do to keep them from multiplying?</p>

<p>8. What else can be done to make sure that no germ
can get to our food or drink?</p></div>

<h2>THE STORY OF THE RAIN BARREL</h2>


<p>O John! did you know that I almost fell on
my head into the rain barrel at the corner of the
house this morning? I was looking at the picture
of myself in the water, when, all of a sudden, I
saw the funniest little things darting everywhere
in the water. I forgot to look at myself or to make
any more faces at the broad face of the little boy
at the bottom of the rain barrel. There were
lots of these queer little things in the rain water.
They were turning somersaults and standing on
their heads every few minutes. Here is a picture
of one. I tried to catch some in my hands, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
they were too quick for me; they would just
wiggle out of reach. This was why I nearly fell
on my head.</p>

<p>I ran into the house to ask Mother about
them. Mothers know a lot, don't they, John?
At least, mine does. I just knew she could tell
me all about these queer little things in the rain
barrel. When I asked her to tell me, she put her
sewing down and went to the rain barrel with me.
As soon as she looked she said she was so glad
that I had come for her, that she would tell me
all about these little "wiggle-tails," and that I
could help her destroy them, as they would do
much harm if they grew up.</p>

<p>She said that they were the little baby mosquitoes.
Isn't that funny? I did not know that
mosquitoes lived in the water, even when they
were babies, did you? I will tell you just what
Mother said. She said that if I were near a pond
or rain barrel, or even an old tin can, in which
water was standing, early in the morning before
the sun was up, I could hear Mrs. Mosquito come
singing merrily to the water, and that if I watched
and did not disturb her, I could see her rest lightly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
on the water and lay her eggs there in a little
brown boat or raft-shaped mass, little eggs like
these. The mosquito mother now thinks her
duty to her children is done, for, after she lays
her eggs on the water, she goes off singing,
never thinking of them again.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i-007.png" width="300" height="78" alt="Mosquito eggs and mother" title="" />
</div>

<p>If nothing disturbs it, the boat of eggs floats
on the water a little longer than a day, when all
of a sudden the shells of the eggs begin to break
and the little "wiggle-tails" hatch, or come out
of the shells. These funny little "wiggle-tails"
go frisking about in the water. They dive here
and there down into the water, hunting for something
to eat. These are the baby mosquitoes.
They are very queer looking, with their big heads
and eyes and a funny little tube at the tail end
of their bodies. They push this tube up out of
the water to get air to breathe. I saw a number
of them push these little tubes up to the top of
the water, but, when I got close to them, down to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the bottom of the barrel they would dive, head
foremost, as if they were scared. They soon had
to come up again for another breath of air.</p>

<p>Mother said that if no one disturbed them
they would eat germs and all sorts of little water
plants for about two weeks, growing all the time.
At the end of that time, each one would curl himself
into a cocoon, like a ball, called a pupa.
After about four days of rest and growing in this
cocoon, the case would break and out would come
a thing with wings, a full-grown mosquito. It would
stand on its case or cocoon, dry its wings in the
sun, and then fly away to begin life as a mosquito.</p>

<p>Mother said she did not want to give the
little "wiggle-tails" a chance to become mosquitoes,
and that if I would bring her some oil from
the kitchen pantry, she would show me how to
kill the little "wiggle-tails." I ran for the oil,
oil just like that your Mamma burns in her lamps.
Mother poured a few spoonfuls in the rain barrel,
and that was the end of Mr. Wiggle-tail. The oil
kept the "wiggle-tails" from getting any air to
breathe through their funny breathing tubes, and
they smothered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Mother says we must have a Mosquito Brigade
and go about the place killing all the mosquitoes;
that we must not let water stand in any tin cans
or barrels; and that we must pour oil in the
ditches and ponds where water stands and where
the mosquitoes can lay eggs. The mosquito will
not lay eggs on the dry land, for the "wiggle-tails"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
cannot take care of themselves on dry
land, and the mosquito mothers know this.</p>

<p>It seems to me that Dame Nature, as Mother
calls her, has taught many wonderful secrets to
her children.</p>

<p>Mother told me why she wanted to kill all the
"wiggle-tails." I will tell you about it to-morrow,
if you will come to the grape-vine swing with me.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>MALARIA</h2>


<p>You remember, John, I told you about the
"wiggle-tails," or baby mosquitoes, in the rain
barrel, and how eager my mother was to put oil
on the water and kill them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, Mother told me a long story about the
baby mosquitoes and what they do when they
are grown up. She said that mosquitoes carry
malaria, or chills, from one person to another.</p>

<p>Don't you remember when we had chills last
summer and Uncle John had to come to see us
and give us some medicine? Mother says that
was because some grown mosquito had bitten a
person who had chills, and while sucking that
person's blood the mosquito had sucked into her
bill some malaria poison; then later when she bit
us, she punched some of that poison into our
blood, while she was getting a supper from our
blood. The mosquito's bill is as sharp as one of
Uncle John's knives.</p>

<p>Mother told me that a long time ago, when
the English came to Virginia, they settled at
Jamestown, and they were afraid of the Indians,
the bears, and the panthers that could hide in the
forest near-by.</p>

<p>The English did not know it, but they had a
more deadly enemy then at Jamestown than the
Indians and the panthers. This enemy was so
small they could not see it, and then, too, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
had not learned about it as we are learning now.
This enemy was the little germ or parasite that
causes malaria.</p>

<p>Mother says that it is easy to fight an enemy
when it is out in the open. The settlers knew
only that many of their people got sick and died.
This was because there were many mosquitoes
there, and these mosquitoes bit them, and put
these poisonous enemies into their blood. But
they did not know that the mosquitoes were the
cause of the great number of deaths in the colony.</p>

<p>All this happened many years ago. I believe
the English thought their old enemy, the Dragon,
of which they had heard so much, but which
they could not see, had come to this new land.</p>

<p>We can know the mosquito that carries malaria
because she looks as if she is trying to stand
on her head when she lights on anything. It
seems queer that the female mosquito is the only
one which poisons us with malaria. Perhaps the
male mosquito cannot bite, because he has so
many feathery plumes on his bill.</p>

<p>The mosquito and the germ of malaria, which
is carried from one person to another, killed far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
more white people than the Indians or the wild
animals did.</p>

<p>Not many years ago, a very clever man found
out that the mosquito carried malaria, for, without
her, the germs could never get into our
blood.</p>

<p>Mother says that the way for us to stop malaria
is for us to kill all the mosquitoes, and the
best way to kill them off is to do so when they
are little "wiggle-tails" or "wigglers." She says
the best way of all, though, is never to have any
standing water around where the mosquito can
lay her eggs.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 135px;">
<img src="images/i-009.png" width="135" height="69" alt="Mosquito" title="" />
</div>

<p>I am going to kill every mosquito I see.
Mother says I can tell the
one that carries malaria, because
she is always trying to
stand on her head like this.</p>

<p>I'll tell you, let's have a "Mosquito and Fly
Brigade." You can be the Captain. All the little
boys and girls in our classes can march under our
colors, and we will make war on every fly and mosquito
in the neighborhood, and stop the children
and grown people from having malaria. Mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
says sickness costs a lot of money&mdash;many millions
of dollars every year.</p>

<p>We will be little soldiers while all the country
is at peace, but we will wage a battle royal
against these very small but strong enemies, and
we will win.</p>

<p>Our motto will be, "To prevent is better than
to cure."</p>

<h2>JACK FROST</h2>


<p>Children, do you know who Jack Frost is?
Well, he is a frisky little fellow. He never seems
to lose his youth and freshness, although he is as
old as time itself.</p>

<p>When the days grow shorter and the nights
get longer, Jack Frost is a regular busybody&mdash;he
is here, there, and everywhere. Jack does not
make long visits in the Sunny Southland. The
warm sunshine and balmy winds chase him back
to the North, his native land.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim lives in the North where Jack Frost
makes long visits, sometimes remaining from early
autumn until late in the spring. Jim says he
likes Jack Frost and the gay times and sports he
brings with him for the little boys and girls of the
North. Jim loves to skate and sleigh ride.</p>

<p>Jack Frost is a mischievous little elf; he
skips gaily around while you are asleep. He
peeps into your windows to see if you are tucked
snugly in bed. He dances on the window panes,
and covers them with beautiful crystals that he
must have brought from fairyland.</p>

<p>He goes whistling down the street on the wind
in the early morning. He gleefully snips at the
noses of the old gentlemen as they step briskly
along to their business.</p>

<p>Jack gives these old folks a bit of his youth as
they feel his frolicsome touch. He makes them
think of the days when they were boys, how they
used to run out to meet him with a jump and a
skip. He reminds them of the days long ago,
when they made a snow man in the school-yard,
and when they played snowball on the way to
and from school. As they think of these frolics<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
with Jack Frost, each one seems to quicken his
step. Could you look into their eyes you would
see how they sparkle with the memories of youth
that Jack Frost has recalled.</p>

<p>He frolics about among the trees. As he
touches them with his wand, their bright green
coat is changed to a soft brown one. He tells
the little sleeping buds to lie still. They must
not even peep out while he is in the air.</p>

<p>Jack waves his wand and covers brown Mother
Earth with sparkling frost or downy snow. The
little seed babies snuggle close, and whisper to
each other of how good Jack Frost is to cover
them from the biting winter wind with this beautiful
warm blanket of snow. This blanket is finer
and warmer than any ever woven by man.</p>

<p>Even after the snow has melted, Jack Frost
tells the little seed babies not to lift their heads
from under their blanket of leaves until the warm
spring days wake them.</p>

<p>He shows to the children of the Southland
only a few of his pranks; now and then a beautiful
frost that is soon chased back to the North
by the warm sun; sometimes a wonderful snow-storm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
from the Northwest. How joyous these
children of the Sunny South are when Jack
does give them a touch of old King Winter!
There are many children here as old as you,
who have never seen one of Jacks beautiful
white blankets.</p>

<p>In the Northland Jack is a very terrible old
fellow. There are ice and snow on the ground for
many months. The people build very warm houses
to keep Jack Frost out.</p>

<p>Did you ever think of the little Eskimo boys
and girls in their cold country? They wear clothes
made of skins and furs. They live in snow houses,
but they manage to keep warm. The little Eskimo
children are used to the cold, for Jack Frost plays
his pranks all the year round in the land of the
long, long nights.</p>

<p>They have great sport going here and there
on their snow-shoes, and in their sleds drawn by
their faithful dogs.</p>

<p>In our own Northland, Jack is a very frisky
fellow. He touches the lakes and rivers with his
magic wand and covers them with ice. Ah! now
comes the best of fun, for now old Jack Frost is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
ready for you to have the finest of sports. You
must put on warm clothes and high, heavy shoes
and run out to play with him.</p>

<p>Children who have colds and sore throats can
not play. So he says, "Wrap up warm, come out
into the fresh air." Let the pure frosty air get into
your lungs, and sweep out old disease germs that
may have hidden there. Come with me to the
pond. The ice is thick and smooth. Put on your
skates and let us go skimming over the ice. You
will feel the warm red blood, made clean and pure
by the frosty air, tingling all over your body. I
tell you, Jack Frost is a good friend.</p>

<p>Jack Frost often hurts the poor, pinching
too hard their fingers and toes. So, while you
are warmly clad and prepared for a frolic with
him, you must remember there are some children
to whom Jack Frost is not such a welcome
friend.</p>

<p>He nips with his cold fingers the insects that
do our plants harm. With his icy breath, he kills
many of the germs that would hurt you.</p>

<p>Jack Frost helps to give you health, and health
means joy, strength, happiness and success.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<h2>A STORY OF TUBERCULOSIS</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">PART I</span></h3>

<p>Mary, did you and Tom see the poor, sick
woman on the cars when we were going to visit
grandmother last week? Did you see how pale
and thin and feeble she looked? Did you hear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
her coughing so often that it seemed to hurt her
whole body?</p>

<p>How sorry we felt when we knew she was so
sick. Don't you remember that Uncle John, who is
a doctor, told us that she had consumption. Uncle
John talked of the poor lady and of the dreadful
disease which she has. He called it by two other
names, tuberculosis and the "Great White Plague."</p>

<p>I'll tell you just what he told me, for Uncle
John said that even little children should know
about this disease and that they could help to
prevent it.</p>

<p>He said that a very small plant, so small that
we cannot see it with our naked eyes, causes this
terrible sickness from which so many, both old and
young, die. These plants are so small that a
thousand of them could be put on a pin head and
still not crowd each other there. These little
plants are like tiny rods and are always found
in the saliva or spit of a person who has consumption.
When Uncle John wants to see them he
uses a very powerful magnifying glass called a
microscope. You have seen this microscope in
Uncle John's office.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Long years ago, a great German doctor tried
to find out why so many persons, young people
and little children, died of this terrible disease.
Finally, after long years of study, he found that
these tiny plants are the cause of all this disease
and sorrow. He also found that these plants are
different from the plants in our gardens, for they
grow best in dark, damp places where there are
warmth and the kind of soil suited to them.</p>

<p>These plants never blossom, but they grow and
make more plants of the same kind.</p>

<p>When father wants to grow more cotton he
plants cotton seed, does he not? He always
sees that the ground or soil is well prepared for
the seed.</p>

<p>Our bodies are the soil or ground, and these
little rod-like plants are the seed of consumption.
Persons who have delicate bodies and who live in
damp, dark places, and who do not eat good food
furnish the best kind of soil on which these plants
will grow. They grow and make more tuberculosis
seed just as the cotton grows and makes more
cotton seed. Strong, healthy bodies are poor seed
ground for consumption seed. They do not grow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
well but shrink up and die just as cotton seed
would if they were planted on stony ground
instead of nice mellow earth.</p>

<p>You have seen some plants that you were told
not to handle or taste because they were poisonous.
Well, these little tuberculosis plants that I
am telling you about are more poisonous than the
plants that you can see.</p>

<p>If they get on cups from which you drink, and
into your milk or any other food, they may get
into your bodies. If you think, I am sure that
you will remember some of your friends who
have consumption.</p>

<p>You remember, Mary, you told me of your
little friend, Lucy Stevens, who has been ill a long
time, and who is quite lame. She has to use
crutches to walk with because her hip is diseased.
Uncle John says this is because she has tuberculosis
of the hip joint. It is strange, but often after
these little plants or seed get into the body,
they may travel to any part of it, and set up house-keeping
for themselves in a gland or a joint.
They usually find their way to the weakest part
of our bodies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Part II</span></h3>

<p>Uncle John says that the only cure for consumption
is plenty of fresh air, good food, and
the proper amount of rest. He says that patent
medicines are fakes and do much harm.</p>

<p>You can, each of you, do a great deal to prevent
these plants or seeds from getting into your
bodies and into the bodies of others by following
these simple rules:</p>

<p>1. Remember that fresh air and sunshine are
necessary to good health.</p>

<p>2. Remember that cold or damp air will not
do harm if the body is kept warm.</p>

<p>3. Breathe through the nose only. Avoid
dark, crowded, dusty, or damp rooms. Breathe
deep.</p>

<p>4. Hold shoulders up.</p>

<p>5. Use your own individual drinking cup.</p>

<p>6. Remember that consumption is spread by
careless spitting. Do not spit on the floor of
rooms, halls, or cars.</p>

<p>7. Keep clean and bathe frequently, at least
twice a week.</p>

<p>8. Always wash your hands before eating.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>9. Brush your teeth after each meal.</p>

<p>10. Never put money, pencils, pens, or anything
that another person has handled, in your
mouth.</p>

<p>11. Do not bite off fruit that other people
have bitten.</p>

<p>12. Do not kiss babies or sick persons.</p>


<div class='center'>QUESTIONS</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. What do you call the little plants that cause
tuberculosis or consumption? How big are these plants
or germs?</p>

<p>2. What part of garden plants are these germs like?
Why do you think so?</p>

<p>3. Big plants in the garden get their food from the
water in the soil. I wonder if any of you can tell me
where these little germ-plants get their food? When we
see persons with consumption we know that these little
germ-plants are growing on the cells of their lungs.
This causes their lung cells and the tissue that binds
them together to decay. Then these people have to
cough and spit this decayed matter up. Every bit of
it is often filled with these little germ-plants, or seed
of consumption.</p>

<p>4. Then what should be done with this spit to keep
any one else from taking the disease?</p>

<p>5. Germs are often carried in little particles of dust.
How may we keep from getting germs in this way?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>6. How else may these little plants get into our
bodies?</p>

<p>7. Can you think of another way by which we
might get these plants into our bodies? (From milk.)
What insect may carry the germs from the sick-room
to our dining-room table?</p>

<p>8. What did Uncle John say was the only cure for
consumption or tuberculosis?</p>

<p>9. What can each of us do to prevent these plants
from getting into our bodies, and to prevent them from
growing if they should happen to get into our bodies?</p></div>

<h2>A TRUE STORY</h2>


<p>In a little city near the great Mississippi River,
lived two boys who were the very best of friends.
Every day they played together and had a fine
time. Life was as pleasant as a summer day to
the little fellows. One of the boys was named
Oliver. He had a rich father who gave him
everything he wanted. The other little boy was
Arthur. His father was dead, but he had a
gentle little mother who was as good as she could
be. Arthur's mother had to work very hard to
make enough money to buy food and clothes for
her little boy and herself. Little Arthur knew
this, and he often said when he got big he would
make enough money for them both, so that the
dear mother would not have to work so hard.</p>

<p>When the two boys were six years old, they
started to school. They were very happy and
proud when the day to go came. Every morning
Oliver's mother would put his fine clothes on him
and give him some money to pay his way on the
street car. After he got to the school he would
not play games with the boys for he was afraid he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
would soil his clothes. He stood around and
watched the other boys romp and play.</p>

<p>Arthur's mother could not give him the ten
cents for car-fare to and from school, so he
walked to school every morning. He would eat
his breakfast early and start out for school in the
cool morning air. As he walked along whistling,
his cheeks would get rosy and red and he would
run and jump; he was a happy little boy. He
felt as if he would never get tired. And all the
time he would be thinking of the time when he
would be a big boy and ready to help to care for
the little mother.</p>

<p>When he got to school he would join the other
little boys in their play, for his clothes were good
and strong and not too fine to romp and play in.</p>

<p>For a long time things went on in this way
and Arthur was growing stronger and taller all
the time. He was learning very fast. Oliver
was getting pale and thin and he was beginning
to be absent from school very often. The teacher
went to see his mother and found that the little
boy was absent because he often had headaches
and colds. The two boys were in the same class,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
but they were not as good friends as they had
been. Oliver could not keep up with his class,
and after awhile he had to drop into a lower class.</p>

<p>Arthur did not have much time to play after
he came home from school because he had to
help his mother.</p>

<p>Their teacher lived just across the street from
the two little boys. She had noticed in school
that Arthur could learn faster than Oliver. She
saw that Arthur was stronger and happier, and
she soon thought she knew why.</p>

<p>So one day she told them both to stay after
school, that she wanted to talk to them for a
little while.</p>

<p>After all the other children had gone she
called them up to her desk and said, "Oliver,
would you like to be like Arthur and have
healthy, rosy cheeks, and be able to run and
play as he does?" Of course, Oliver said yes, for
he had long been wishing that he could feel as
happy as Arthur looked. He wanted to be able
to come regularly to school, and he did not want to
have colds and headaches&mdash;he was tired of them.</p>

<p>"Well," said the teacher, "I want to tell you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
how you may grow as strong as Arthur. You
must stay out-of-doors, and play with the other
boys more than you do. You look pale because
your blood is not red enough.</p>

<p>"Boys and girls have blood in their bodies.
You have seen it when you cut your finger. The
more you run and play, the more blood you will
have and the redder it will be. This good red
blood is what makes you strong; you must eat
plenty of good food and play out in the open air
with the other boys. Keep your body clean, and
get your mother to let you walk to school each
morning with Arthur. Now run along to play, and
I am sure you will soon feel better, and after a few
days you will be as strong as Arthur and the other
boys."</p>


<div class='center'>QUESTIONS</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Compare the two boys&mdash;Arthur and Oliver&mdash;as
to their pleasures and opportunities.</p>

<p>2. Why did Arthur study hard and love to work?</p>

<p>3. Why did Oliver ride on the street car to school,
and why could he not run and play with the other boys
after he got to school?</p>

<p>4. Oliver was sick a great deal and could not keep
up with his class. Why did his teacher say that he
could not do his work as well as Arthur?</p></div>

<img src="images/i-011.png" width="400" height="328" alt="Two Little Windows" title="" />
</div>




<h2>TWO LITTLE WINDOWS</h2>


<p>In every house there is a window. Some
houses have many windows to let in the bright
sunshine and the pure fresh air, and to let us see
from within the glorious world on the outside.</p>

<p>I am going to tell you of some houses that have
only two windows; the houses cannot do without
them.</p>

<p>Many of the little windows are beautiful. On
the outside are two beautiful awnings with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
pretty black fringe on the edge; the awnings keep
out the light when it is too bright, and keep insects
and bugs from flying in at the windows. At
night these awnings are drawn over the windows
so that the little housekeeper within may have
rest and quiet.</p>

<p>The window casings are white and on the inside
there are dainty curtains. Some of these
curtains are blue, some are brown, some are
gray, and some are black. In the centre of these
curtains there is a round black hole. It is through
this little hole that the housekeeper can look out
and see the beautiful world around.</p>

<p>When the windows are bright and sparkling
we know that the house is strong and well kept,
and the little housekeeper is happy when she plays
and when she works.</p>

<p>Only one person can live in each house. A
queer thing about these little houses is that they
can move from place to place.</p>

<p>Sometimes these little windows are not cared
for; the little housekeeper forgets how important
the windows are. I know of some that are not
cared for. These were very pretty and seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
larger than most windows of this kind. They had
deep brown curtains and when you looked at the
little hole in the curtain, it seemed that you were
looking down into a deep well, and that you could
see your own picture in it. The little housekeeper
who owned these windows was a little girl almost
ten years old. She would look through the windows
and read fine print when it was too dark to
see the letters well, and would do many things
that would hurt these windows. Her mother had
to take her to a person in a big city who knew
what to do to help the windows. This man put
a piece of glass in front of the windows, so that
the little housekeeper could see through them.
How sorry this housekeeper was that she had not
always taken care of her windows.</p>

<p>We sometimes see little housekeepers whose
windows are always dark. It is a pitiful sight to
see windows through which no light ever goes to
the housekeeper within the house. "Shut-ins,"
they are in truth. It makes one's heart ache to
know that if many of these windows had had
proper care when they were first opened the
housekeeper's hearts would now be glad, for they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
could look out on the glorious world, they could
read and play and work just as little children
like to do. Instead, they must go to special
schools. They read from books that have raised
letters, and use their fingers to find them. Many
of these little housekeepers learn to read and do
many wonderful things with their fingers. Helen
Keller, whose windows were always dark, even
graduated from Radcliffe College.</p>


<div class='center'><br />QUESTION</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Can you tell me what these little windows are?
You have already guessed that the little house is the
body, and the little housekeeper any little boy or girl.</p></div>

<h2>A WONDERFUL STREAM</h2>


<p>I am going to tell you of a wonderful stream
that flows through our bodies. We may call it
the stream of life. It is made of tiny rills, and
of great branches, all of which join to form this
wonderful stream.</p>

<p>This stream has a great, double force pump,
which keeps pumping night and day. It always
pumps the same way, its engine does not make
much noise, but just a little sound that you may
hear if you put your ear close to mother's breast.
You can hear this busy little engine pumping
away, forcing the stream on.</p>

<p>Many queer looking little boats float on its
bosom. These boats carry freight to the far-away
countries in all parts in the body. They are
so small we cannot see them with the naked eye.
They are of various shapes; some are round.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>They have a very important freight to carry.
There are more of these boats than there are of
any other kind. They have a little cup-shaped
centre, a kind of deck, and in this centre they
carry the freight. They take on this freight at
the Lung Station. They have something on deck
which holds on to the goods they get at the station,
to keep it from being lost on its long journey.</p>

<p>It never overflows its banks. Its color is not
bright and blue as the waters of the Hudson or
Potomac Rivers. It is yellow and red, like the
Mississippi, the great "Father of Waters." If you
would taste it you would find it to be salty like
the ocean.</p>

<p>As soon as the little boats load up at the Lung
Station, off they sail on this wonderful stream,
carrying their freight to the Muscle Country, the
Skin Country or the Gland Country. When the
boats reach one of these countries, they unload
and the little men of these countries (or cells)
take the freight and put it just where it is needed.
The freight is called oxygen. The Lung Station
is filled with it every time a person takes a good
breath of pure fresh air.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The little boats come to Lung Station and load
up with oxygen about three times every minute,
so you see how fast they travel. This freight is
the thing that paints our cheeks a rosy color and
gives us good health.</p>

<p>When each little boat has unloaded its cargo
in the far countries, the little cell men load them
with a return cargo, which is made up of waste
matter (carbon dioxide). This cargo is carried
back to the Lung Station, and unloaded there. It
is breathed out into the air, through the air tubes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 175px;">
<img src="images/i-014.png" width="175" height="149" alt="Blood" title="" />
</div>

<p>If we breathe impure air, the little boats go
back to the far countries
with only a small cargo
of oxygen. Then the cell
men feel as if they are
cheated and refuse to do
good work for us. In
fact, they grow weak and
cannot do as good work as they could if the boats
brought a full cargo of fresh air.</p>

<p>There is another boat in the stream; just look
at its queer shape, and, queerer still, this little boat is
changing its shape. Is not that funny? Now the small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
end is toward us, now the large end, and now it is
round like the little freight boats, only it is larger.</p>

<p>I wonder what kind of a vessel it is. It is
larger than the freight boat. There are not so
many of these boats either, not half so many as
there are freight boats. They are flying white
flags, and belong to the White Squadron. I wonder
if that means peace.</p>

<p>No, they are war-vessels. Let us see what
these white ships are doing. We will call them
Dreadnoughts. Watch them as they move slowly
down the stream; how powerful they look. They
have their searchlights on, looking for any enemy
that may appear upon the surface.</p>

<p>Further on some germs or bacteria are coming
up the stream; they may be pneumonia germs, or
typhoid germs. These are the Captains of the
Death Armada. The Dreadnoughts pull up along
side. War is declared, a battle royal is on. The
victory will go to the strongest. When the smoke
clears away we may see the Dreadnought sailing
calmly down stream. Where now are these
mighty Goliaths, the typhoid or pneumonia germs?
As the Dreadnoughts were in good fighting trim,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
we may find them on the inside of the engine-room
of the Dreadnought. They are being used as fuel
in its furnace.</p>

<p>Sometimes the battle is in favor of the germs,
and the Dreadnought is destroyed by the germs.</p>

<p>This happens when the little round freight
boats have not found a full cargo of fresh air and
oxygen waiting for them in the Lung Station.</p>

<p>All this happens in this wonderful stream.</p>

<p>If we look further we would find that the
muscle men in the muscle countries are busy making
heat to keep our bodies warm. The little
workmen in the gland country are making fluids
to mix with the food we eat. The fluids change the
starch, the sugar, and the meat we eat, so that the
muscle men can use it to build us large and strong.
The little workmen in the skin are pouring water
out of it in order that we may keep clean and cool.</p>

<p>This wonderful stream carries all these things
from one country to the other, exchanges the
produce of one country for the produce of another&mdash;so
to speak.</p>

<p>The little freight boats on this stream cannot
do the work they were intended to do, the Dreadnoughts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
cannot overcome and disable the germs
that get on their decks, if they are not kept in
the very best condition. The only way in which
we can keep them "fit" is by living according to
the rules of hygiene.</p>

<p>Eat wholesome food.</p>

<p>Take outdoor exercise.</p>

<p>Sleep with the windows open.</p>

<p>Drink pure water.</p>

<p>Bathe the body frequently.</p>

<h2>TWO MILLS</h2>


<p>Come, children, listen to the story Uncle Ned
told to me. It was the story of a long time ago
when Uncle Ned was a little boy. One day his
mother took him on her knee and said, "Ned, do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
you know that your mouth is like a little mill?"
It is. The mill grinds corn. Your teeth grind
your food. Look in the mirror. Are your teeth
all alike? Some of the teeth in your mouth are
to bite the food into bits, and others are to grind
it fine so that it will not hurt your stomach.</p>

<p>You have twenty now because you are a little
boy and do not need any more. When you have
grown to be a man you will have thirty-two
teeth. You will have more grinders in your
mouth when you are a man than you have now.
The jaw teeth are called grinders, because they
grind the food you put into your mouth, just as
the big mill stones grind the corn into meal down
at Grandpa's mill.</p>

<p>You wear clothes to keep your bodies warm,
so the teeth need some covering to keep out the
cold. The enamel, a hard outer covering on the
teeth, keeps them from feeling the cold. Down
in the middle of the tooth is a place for the
nerves of the tooth. When you break the covering
on the tooth the cold and hot things that you
sometimes put into your mouth will make the
nerves ache. Sometimes things that are very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
sweet or very sour hurt the covering on the
teeth.</p>

<p>To use the teeth to crack nuts or ice will
harm them, for it often breaks the outer covering,
and it will not grow again.</p>

<p>Your teeth should last you all your life if you
will take care of them. Grandpa's mill would
not grind the corn well, nor would the mill last
long, if he did not take care of it and keep the
big stone grinders clean and free from grit and
dirt. Your teeth must have just as good care as
the stones in the mill if you wish them to last you
a long time, and if you want them to grind your
food fine.</p>

<p>This is why you must use your toothbrush, and
wash your mouth out regularly every day. If
you do not keep your mouth clean, germs will
creep in and cause the little boy to have toothache.
You are wondering what the germs have
to do with toothache.</p>

<p>These little germs always get into places that
are not kept clean, and when they get into the
mouth they go to work, like so many little carpenters,
with pick and drill, and pick away the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
outer covering of the tooth and then the tooth
decays, and this causes toothache.</p>

<p>We all want to have pretty white teeth like
Ned's, do we not? When we are little we must
take care of the teeth, and if they begin to decay
we must have them filled or treated by the dentist.
Let us look at our teeth and see who has the
prettiest and the best ones. Has every one a
toothbrush? We must each have one. We must
brush our teeth every day and rinse them with
pure clean water. This will wash out all the
germs that would soon injure our teeth if they
were left in the mouth.</p>

<p>If we will care for our teeth when we are
young we will not need to have false teeth when
we are old.</p>


<div class='center'>QUESTIONS</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. What are our mouths like? Why like a mill?</p>

<p>2. What is there in the mouth that corresponds to
the rocks in the mill?</p>

<p>3. Is there a little baby in your home? Has it any
teeth? Can you tell me why? Yes, that is right. Teeth
are given us to chew food with. The little baby does
not eat any hard or solid food, and therefore he does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
not need any teeth yet. When he is a little older pretty
white teeth will be given him. By the time he is four
or five years old he will have twenty of these little baby
teeth. But he cannot keep the first teeth long. They
would be too little and weak to do him much good when
he gets to be a big boy.</p>

<p>4. Did you ever notice the twig of a tree just after
the leaves had fallen? What did you find on the stem
where the old leaf had grown? That is right, a tiny
new leaf was pushing its way out. And that is just
what happens to the teeth. When a boy or girl gets
to be about eight or ten years old, a set of new teeth
begins to grow down in the gums under the baby teeth.
As these new teeth grow longer they push up the baby
teeth, and cause them to get loose and fall out. When
the new teeth appear they are strong and hard, that
they may last a long time, if taken care of as Uncle Ned
did his.</p>

<p>5. How many things do we know that we may do to
make our teeth last a long time?</p></div>

<h2>MR. FLY AND MRS. MOSQUITO</h2>


<p>One day in the summer, Mr. Fly and Mrs.
Mosquito stopped to rest on the window pane of
a house in the country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i-016.png" width="400" height="202" alt="Flies at the window" title="" />
</div>

<p>Mr. Fly, after sitting for some time rubbing his
nose with his front feet, looked up and said, "Good
morning."</p>

<p>"Mr. Fly," replied Mrs. Mosquito, "I do not
believe that we have met before."</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Fly, "but I am glad to meet
you to-day. I have long wanted to do so. May
I ask where you live?"</p>

<p>"Ah me, Mr. Fly," replied Mrs. Mosquito, "I
have been having a rather hard time lately. You
have heard of my family, and know that with a
number of brothers and sisters, I was hatched in
a small pond near the meadow. Life went well
with us for a while. But one afternoon I heard footsteps
coming nearer and nearer. I could not understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
what terrible beast was coming down to
the pond to drink. I shivered with fear and darted
as fast as I could to the bottom of the pond.
However, I soon had to come to the top again to
get a good breath, as I thought I was going to
suffocate. Dearie me, why cannot we get air at
the bottom of the pond as well as at the top.</p>

<p>"My heart was beating with fear as I still heard
the footsteps, and presently I could hear voices.
A voice said, 'Where are all the members of this
brigade?' What could it mean? What is a brigade?
Someone cried out, 'Here we come to
give him the oil.' Looking up I saw a number of
girls and boys, 'The Mosquito Brigade,' they called
themselves. They laughed and talked as if they
were a gay crowd. One said, 'Here they are,'
and then said, 'This will get them.'</p>

<p>"I wondered what in the world they could
mean. I soon learned what they were about.</p>

<p>"I smelled a terrible odor, and peeping out from
the mud (at the bottom of the pond in which I
was hiding), I saw something thick and terrible
coming down like rain in the pond.</p>

<p>"I ran through the mud to the far end of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
pond and hid. Oh, how that stuff did smell! I
thought it would surely smother me.</p>

<p>"I stayed in the mud until the next day. I did
not dare peep out. When I did look out nothing
could I see on the bottom of the pond but my
dead brothers and sisters. They had not been as
quick as I and had been smothered by that dreadful
stuff. Ah me! I had scarcely strength enough
to live. Life seemed very hard.</p>

<p>"The next thing I remember I was sailing
down the pond in a canoe Mother Nature built
for me. It was just large enough to be perfectly
comfortable. I slept the greater part of the time
I was in the little canoe. I stayed in there several
days and many times old Father Wind sent a
breeze that nearly upset my little craft. I grew
some wings finally and flew away from that awful
pond. I hope that I can always escape that 'Mosquito
Brigade' and that deadly oil. I shall be very
busy for a while and may yet have my revenge, if
I can poison some member of it with malaria germs.</p>

<p>"I have finished my story. Pray, tell me of
yourself, Mr. Fly, you look very happy." "Well,"
said the fly, "I was hatched in the corner of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
stable where it was damp and warm. I stayed in
an egg one day. Then I was a white crawling thing
for nine days. I ate all this time. At the end of
that time I slept a while and then I was grown.
I can't tell you how big I felt the day I first
stretched my wings for flight.</p>

<p>"Just listen to what I have done since that
happy day. I have crawled over a person who
had small-pox and got some germs which I carried
to a girl across the street. I went into a house
and sat on a bed in which a little girl was lying.
The doctor came in and after staying there a
while he said, 'Typhoid fever.' I was sorry for the
little child with her red swollen face. I left her
and walked on the bed. I knew that my feet
were loaded with germs when I flew out. Off I
went to the country.</p>

<p>"The first home I passed, a little tot of a boy,
sitting on the step, was eating milk and mush out
of a bowl. When he took the spoon from his
mouth I got into it and sucked all the milk I could
get. I left him the germs that I had been carrying.
This was a pretty good day's work, don't you
think? The next morning I flew away to the next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
house, but dear me, I found that a fly would have
to carry his own rations there.</p>

<p>"This was a new thing to me. I met one of
my friends who told me that it would be just as
well for me to travel on. The folks who lived in
this house had been going to the lectures of the
Health Doctor. The doctor had told them to
clean up the stable, to screen the house, and to
cover the well. I tell you, Mrs. Mosquito, that
man is trying to put me out of business. I fear
that I shall have a hard time in the future if he
stays in this neighborhood. I am not as happy
as I once was, so I will say good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, friend Fly," said Mrs. Mosquito,
"I am glad we met near our old home."</p>

<p>"Hello, Central, give me 1882,
Mrs. Consumption Germ. Oh, is
that you, I am so glad to hear
your voice. Do tell me what you
have been doing this long time!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my good friend Pneumonia,
I have been hiding away all these years to
keep the doctors from finding me. I did not want
them to learn about me. I feared that they would
destroy me entirely.</p>

<p>"But with all my care, do you know that just
a few years ago, an old German doctor pulled me
out of my hiding place and showed me to the
world. Since then I and my family have had
little peace.</p></div></td>
</tr></table></div>



<p>"I have to be mighty careful, or I fear that
these doctors who are turning all sorts of magnifying
glasses on my people will finally drive us
from the earth. They already have us on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
run. In the meantime we are playing a game of
'catch me if you can.' Sometimes we get on pencils
or sticks of candy. Then again we roll and
turn somersaults on a nice red apple and are passed
from one mouth to another by over-polite children.</p>

<p>"Sometimes, some of my children swim in the
milk or travel on a fly's foot.</p>

<p>"I don't like sunshine at all. I dote on dark
places where the wind does not blow.</p>

<p>"I like poor people better than rich ones,
because the poor have not money enough to buy
good food, fresh air, and rest, the weapons the
rich use to fight us with.</p>

<p>"Last week I went to a Fourth of July celebration
on a grain of dust&mdash;my airship, I called it.
Whom do you think I saw there? Young Mr.
Lockjaw Germ; do you know I think that he
has gotten the big head. Probably the war in
Europe has something to do with it. For I
believe that he and his family are very prominent
among the soldiers in Belgium. I hear also that
in America the folks are trying to put him out of
business, especially since fire-crackers are not used
so much. Some man had to start a 'Sane Fourth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of July.' That was a sane Fourth of July celebration
that I attended, and I must say that Mr.
Lockjaw Germ looked a bit lonely."</p>

<p>"Do tell me, Mrs. Consumption Germ," said
her friend Pneumonia Germ, "have you heard
about the Diphtheria family? They are having a
hard time."</p>

<p>"These French doctors have found something
that will even prevent children from having diphtheria.
They call it anti-toxin. I never did like
antis anyway, did you?</p>

<p>"Mrs. Typhoid Germ tells me that her family is
not as large as it used to be, all because of an
anti-toxin."</p>

<p>"My, my, what shall we do!" said Mrs. Consumption
Germ, "even the school people are after us. I
heard Miss Measles and little Master Scarlet Fever
say that a doctor comes every day to some of the
schools. They said that in some of the school-rooms
the teacher had the nerve to hang a placard, on
which was printed, 'Prevention Better Than Cure.'</p>

<p>"I'll tell you I don't like these new times; this
Hygiene the people talk of is a regular ogre to
our children.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"In some schools the teachers are even having
lunches for the little children who are pale and
thin. They are having their eyes examined.
Some are having adenoids taken out, just to make
those children so strong that we can't catch them.</p>

<p>"I thought that I had a fair chance to get
little Jimmy Brown, but his teacher talked to his
mother one day at recess. The next day his
mother whisked him off down town and had the
doctor take the adenoids from behind his nose.
Now he is as strong as any little boy, because he
can breathe through his nose. So I lost my
chance at him, you see."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said Mrs. Consumption Germ,
"one can't even hide in an old stump of a tooth.
Some man with sharp-looking things tells you that
o-u-t spells 'out and begone,' as we used to say
in playing the game."</p>

<p>"Do you know I believe that man Pasteur
was our greatest enemy?"</p>

<p>"Tell me, who was he?" said Mrs. Consumption
Germ.</p>

<p>"Well, he was a man who lived in France.
He discovered the germ that killed the silk-worm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and also the cause of the loss of grapes in that
country.</p>

<p>"The wine and silk merchants of that country
paid him immense sums of money for this
work.</p>

<p>"He studied all about our friends and relatives,
and it was he who first started all this anti-toxin,
which saves the people, but which kills us
by the millions.</p>

<p>"But with all this great work and the work
of their great men, we sometimes catch folks napping.
We catch our greatest enemy, the white
blood-cells, when they are without their fighting
clothes on, and then we get busy. In this way
we can make up for a great deal of lost time.</p>

<p>"Of course, you have heard of Dr. Jenner.
He was another enemy of ours. He taught the
people about vaccination, which keeps them from
having small-pox. I am glad to say there will
always be a few persons who do not follow these
new ideas. If this were not true, one would
starve to death."</p>

<p>"I know, Mrs. Pneumonia Germ, that you
love close, damp, places. I am sure that fresh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
air makes you nervous. What will you do now
that the factories and mills are to be cleaner and
better ventilated? We used to find plenty to do
with the old order of things.</p>

<p>"Dr. Sunshine, Dr. Fresh Air, and Dr. Good
Food are certainly doing all they can to drive us
out of the country.</p>

<p>"We will go to the great cities, and I suspect
that, for a long time yet, we can find a home for
our little ones in the miserable homes of the poor;
and, notwithstanding all this talk of hygiene,
health, and sanitation, I believe that some of the
homes and factories will always furnish us with
hiding places in which to rear our families."</p>

<p>"Well, I must say good-bye, Mrs. Germ, as I
see Dr. Fresh Air coming, and I do not care to
speak to him; he does not treat me cordially.
Good-bye."</p>

<h2>CLOVIS, THE BOY KING</h2>


<p>Long, long ago, on the banks of the Rhine,
there lived a brave and war like tribe called
Franks. Their name means "Freemen." I always
think Frank is a very nice name for a boy or
girl to have. It is so grand to be really and
truly free.</p>

<p>These Franks had for their leader a king, and,
at the time I am going to tell about, their king
was a boy. His name was Clovis and he was only
sixteen years old. You would hardly think that
a boy could rule those fierce warriors, but he was
such a brave and fearless boy, and had such a
good sensible head that they were glad to follow
him. He was never afraid of anything, even when
he was a little fellow, and he could tame and ride
the wildest horse as well as the best man among
them.</p>

<p>One day a great idea came into the heads of
the Frankish warriors. They thought they would
leave their old homes on the banks of the Rhine
and go and settle in a new country called Gaul.
It would have been easy enough, perhaps, if there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
had been nobody there but the natives and the
wild beasts, but that was not the case.</p>

<p>The Romans were there. I am sure you have
heard of the Romans and how very strong and
warlike they were. Their soldiers conquered the
world and were very seldom beaten. They had
an army in this country of Gaul.</p>

<p>Clovis was not afraid of the Romans, however,
and he marched against them. The two armies
stood facing each other and the two leaders came
out to speak together in an open space between
the camps.</p>

<p>The Roman general was very big and grand,
and he had Roman soldiers on each side of him in
splendid uniform. Clovis was accompanied by
some of his brave followers. When the Roman
leader saw Clovis, he burst out laughing and cried,
"Why, he's a boy! A <i>boy</i> has come to fight
against the Romans!" He thought it was so
funny that a boy of sixteen should dare to fight
against him that he couldn't do anything but
laugh. Clovis did not like this at all, and he
shouted back, "Yes, but the boy will conquer
you!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">
<img src="images/i-019.png" width="379" height="500" alt="&quot;YES, BUT THE BOY WILL CONQUER YOU!&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;YES, BUT THE BOY WILL CONQUER YOU!&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came the battle, and the Roman general
found it wasn't so funny after all. For the boy
did conquer him and he ran away. Afterwards
the Franks gained the country for themselves and
called it their own name, France.</p>

<p>I believe in boys. I think they can do almost
anything. I believe in girls, too, just as much. The
girls did not fight in this battle I have been telling
you about, but there is another and better kind of
battle in which boys and girls fight side by side.</p>

<p>The old kind of battle in which men were
killed, and little children lost their fathers, was
very bad and very sad, at the best. In the
new kind of battle people don't kill each other,
and yet they fight very hard against their enemies
and have to be very brave.</p>

<p>Let me tell you about a few of these battles.
One that is going on now is the battle against
Disease. Very likely you have heard the grown
folks talk about consumption, and saying that it
is one of the worst enemies of our American people,
and kills thousands and thousands every year.
Men and women and boys and girls are joining
together to fight against consumption and make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
an end to it, and a big fight it is. Then, again,
in the struggle with yellow fever some of our noble
American heroes willingly laid down their lives.</p>

<p>Another great battle is against Dirt. Dirt
causes people to get sick and die, and since we
have known this we have been fighting hard
against it. The boys and girls have helped a
great deal in this battle.</p>

<p>One of the finest fights to be in is the battle
against Tobacco. What do you think? Could
the boys and girls defeat the use of tobacco and
drive it out of the country if they tried hard
enough? I really believe they could.</p>

<p>But, perhaps, you have not all made up your
minds that it would be a good thing to fight
tobacco. Let us think of some of the reasons
why we should fight it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reason Number One</span> is because the tobacco
habit is a dirty habit. Are the lips of the smoking
boy nice and clean for mother to kiss? What
about his hands? Isn't he ashamed of that yellow
stain that won't come off? How much cleaner
the streets, and cars, and railway stations would
be if nobody used tobacco!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reason Number Two</span> is because tobacco injures
a boy's body. It hurts his heart, causing it
to beat too fast for a while and afterwards making
it weak and tired. It hurts his lungs, for when
he draws the smoke in he carries the poisonous
nicotine to the tender and delicate air-cells. We
must talk more about that at another time. It
hurts his stomach and gives him indigestion, and
no one knows how bad that is until he has had it
for himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reason Number Three</span> is because tobacco
harms a boy's mind. Boys who don't smoke
make better grades than those who do. Some
college boys found this out for themselves a while
ago. Don't you forget it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reason Number Four</span> is because it is a dangerous
habit. The insurance men, whose business
it is to find out what causes the fires, say that
cigarette smokers are often to blame, because
they throw the cigarettes down with fire on them.</p>

<p>If you spend nickels on cigarettes, a dollar is
soon gone. You don't exactly burn the dollar
bill, but you spend the bill and buy cigarettes,
and burn them. Isn't that just the same as burning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the bill, after all? If a boy spends a nickel a
day on cigarettes, how much will he lose in a
week? Thirty cents in six week-days. In four
weeks, what will he have spent? A dollar and
twenty cents. A month is a little over four weeks,
so we will add an extra nickel to find what he
spends a month. A dollar and a quarter. How
much will this come to in twelve months? Is that
too hard for you, I wonder? Fifteen dollars.
Dear me, how quickly money runs away! Surely
no one ought to smoke cigarettes unless he has
more money than he knows what to do with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reason Number Five</span> is because smoking is an
enslaving habit. By that I mean it makes boys
into slaves.</p>

<p>So here are five reasons why we should fight
against it. Let us see how many of them you
can remember.</p>

<p>I hope that all you boys and girls will be as
brave as Clovis, and now that you see how much
harm tobacco and alcohol are doing to your people,
you will get ready for the fight and will say,
"Yes, you are strong and terrible foes, but boys
and girls will conquer you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

</div>




<h2>THE WHITE SHIP</h2>


<p>We are going to have a story to-day about
something that happened nearly eight hundred
years ago.</p>

<p>In that far-away time there lived a King of
England whose name was Henry I. He was a
great warrior, and his enemies generally had the
worst of it in battle. But he was still greater as
a ruler, and he made the people of England keep
the laws. When they disobeyed, he punished them
severely.</p>

<p>A certain scholar wrote down the story of his
reign and we have it still. He said Henry "was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
a good man and great was the awe of him."
That is, the people rather feared him because he
was so strict. He said, too, that while Henry was
king no one dared "ill-do to man or beast."</p>

<p>King Henry was sometimes called the Lion
of Justice, because he was so great and powerful,
and all wrong-doers were afraid of him.</p>

<p>He had another nickname, too. They called
him Fine Scholar because he could read and
write. Very few persons in those old days could
do these things. The clergy were almost the only
ones who went to school and learned how.</p>

<p>We who live now-a-days should be very glad
and thankful that we have good schools and
kind teachers, and lesson books that are full of
interesting things.</p>

<p>King Henry had one son whom he loved very
much, indeed. His name was William. He was
a fine boy, and the people of England were very
fond of him. They expected that some day, when
his father died, William would be King in his
turn. Indeed, they had already promised Henry
that whenever that happened, they would be
faithful and true to his son.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Not very far from England is the country
called France. A narrow sea separates the two.
The English call it the Channel and the French
call it the Sleeve&mdash;perhaps because it is something
like a sleeve in shape.</p>

<p>Henry was very often over in France because
he had some possessions there. His father had
come from France and conquered England, so he
had land on both sides of this narrow sea. Though
it is narrow, it is very rough, and sailors have to
be very careful in crossing it.</p>

<p>One time Henry and his son had been over in
France doing some fighting. They overcame their
enemies and made ready to set sail for England.
They were about to start when a captain came
up to the King and begged him to sail in his
ship. He was very anxious to have the honor of
carrying him across the Channel. He had carried
over the King's father, William the Conqueror,
when he went to invade England. He said that he
had a beautiful new boat called the White Ship.
There were fifty strong men to do the rowing,
and they had sails besides. Of course, there were
no steam-boats in those old times.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Now King Henry had already made his
arrangements, and he did not like to change
them. But, to please the captain, he said he
would send his treasure in his new ship&mdash;the
precious things he had taken in war and was
carrying home to England. More than that, he
said he would let the captain take charge of the
greatest treasure he had in the world, his only son,
who was then seventeen years old. So William
sailed with Captain Fitz-Stephen.</p>

<p>The King was in a hurry to get home, and he
started as soon as the tide would let him.</p>

<p>In the White Ship with Prince William a great
many knights and nobles sailed. Some of his own
relatives were there, and many boys and girls
belonging to the chief families of England. They
wanted to have a good time, so they had a grand
feast on board ship before they started on the
voyage. They shouted and danced on the deck,
and, I am sorry to say, they drank a great deal
of wine. They did one thing that was specially
foolish. They made the sailors drink, too. They
opened three barrels of the wine and divided it
among them. They ought to have known that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the sailors would need steady hands to take the
ship across that dangerous sea. But they did not
think. It grew later and later, and darker and
darker, and there was no moon that night. Some
people began to be afraid to trust themselves in
that ship, and they got off and waited till morning
for another one. Most of them, however, were feeling
too merry and jolly to be afraid of anything,
and away they sailed. The rowers pulled with all
their might and the helmsman steered for England.</p>

<p>A man who has been using strong drink,
though, is not fit to steer a ship or anything else.
It has been found out that after even a very little
wine or beer one cannot guide so well, or do anything
else properly that needs a clear brain and
steady nerves.</p>

<p>Alcohol makes people stupid. We all know
that if they drink a good deal of it, it takes their
senses altogether away, so that they don't know
anything and can't do anything. So, if they
drink a little of it, it takes their senses partly away
and they are not so bright as they should be.
They do not see danger when it comes and then
accidents happen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>The helmsman of the White Ship was made
stupid by the wine and he was not able to do his
work. They had not gone very far before he
steered the ship on a rock. There was a terrible
crash and a terrible cry, and the water began to
rush in through the hole which had been made.</p>

<p>Quickly a boat was lowered and Prince William
was hurried into it, and the rowers rowed
away with him. But he heard a voice calling
for help and knew it was his sister's, so he made
the sailors turn back to save her. When they did
so, ever so many people jumped in and the little
boat could not hold them. They all went to the
bottom.</p>

<p>No one escaped from that dreadful shipwreck
except one man who held on to the top of the
mast till help came next day. When, at last, he
reached land he told how the young prince and
his sister had been drowned, and also a hundred
and forty noble youths and girls, and the Captain
and the fifty rowers, and everyone else on board
except himself&mdash;all because of wine.</p>

<p>What a dangerous drink this alcohol is, and
how many accidents it has caused! It sends the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
brain to sleep so that it cannot do its work, and
when that is the case we never know what
dreadful thing may happen next.</p>

<p>When anything puts the brain to sleep, we call
it narcotic. Alcohol is a narcotic poison. No
one should ever use it who wants to pilot a ship,
or steer an automobile, or drive a train, or shoot
a gun, or run a machine in a factory.</p>

<p>King Henry was a busy man, and he went
home as quickly as he could and attended to
his work. He was very much surprised that
William and the others did not come, and he
kept wondering where they could be.</p>

<p>When the sad news reached the palace, no
man dared go in and tell the King. At last, they
sent a little boy into his room&mdash;a page who waited
on the ladies and gentlemen&mdash;and he fell at the
King's feet.</p>

<p>"O, King .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Prince William .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
White Ship!"</p>

<p>When poor King Henry understood what had
happened, he fell down in a faint. They say that
all the rest of his life he was very sad. No one
ever saw him smile again. One thing we must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
never forget about strong drink is this: It does
not only bring trouble to the people who use it,
but to many others besides. King Henry had
nothing to do with the drinking on board the
White Ship. He was not even there, and did not
know about it. But it caused him to lose his
boy and girl, both in one night.</p>

<p>In our days, too, it makes more trouble than
any one can possibly imagine. Although the
wreck of the White Ship happened nearly eight
hundred years ago, it was not by any means the
first accident brought on by alcohol. Drink has
always done these things. It has always made
men's heads dull and their hands unsteady. It
has caused them to be hurt and to lose their lives.
The strange thing is that, although every one
knows it does this, so many people venture to
use it. We should all do well to remember the
proverb, "Where there's drink there's danger."</p>

<h2>A QUEER CASE</h2>


<p>Agnes, you and John may look at this watch.
Don't you think its covering is very pretty? The
covering of the watch is called its case. Now we
will open it, and you may look inside and see
what this pretty case covers. Look at all these
little wheels. How small they are! Do you think
they would stay in place long, or run and keep
time, if we bruised them or took off the case?
Then you see the case is not only pretty, but
useful. It keeps the little wheels from getting
broken or dirty. It protects them from harm.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 201px;">
<img src="images/i-021.png" width="201" height="400" alt="IS THIS YOU?" title="" />
<span class="caption">IS THIS YOU?</span>
</div>
<p>Look at the covering or case of your body.
It covers and protects you just as the case does
the works in the watch. Well, let me tell you a
story about it. The covering of your body covers
a number of organs which are even more wonderful
than the little wheels in the watch.</p>

<p>This covering of your body is full of little holes.
These holes are too small to be seen with our
naked eyes. Through these holes air and sunshine
get into your body, and through these tiny
holes little drops of water come out. This is sweat,
and it helps to keep our bodies cool. When you run<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and play, these little drops of water keep you
from getting too warm. They also help to keep
your body clean by
bringing out the little
bits of dirt.</p>



<p>I wonder if we are
like a little pig, who,
when his mother asked
him what kind of a
house he wanted, said,
"mud house?" If so,
we will have the little
holes all closed up.
Then we won't have a
nice, soft, pink skin
that will let the little
drops of water through,
but we will have a dirty,
muddy-looking skin.
When we run and play
we get so warm that it will make us sick. But if
we take nice warm baths twice a week at night,
and a cool sponge bath every morning, with good
clear water and soap, we will be like the watch,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and have a beautiful covering, and this will help
to keep our wonderful organs and body well and
strong. We must bathe our hands often, and keep
the covering on them nice and clean. Sometimes
germs get on our hands, and, if we do not wash
them often, we may carry them to our mouths.
Sometimes this is the way we "catch" a disease,
because we do not keep the covering, or case, on
our hands clean.</p>

</div>

<p>Did you ever watch the little birds as they fly
down to a gutter, or little stream of water, how
they dip their bills into the water? Do they just
fly down into the water only to get a drink?
No, indeed. They fill their bills with water and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
pour it all over their feathers. They get into the
water, and such a splashing they have! All birds
and animals wash themselves clean and nice when
they can get to water. Old Rover has a good
time swimming and bathing in the creek. This
is the way they keep their skins nice and clean,
and their hair and feathers slick and shining.</p>

<span class="caption">THE LITTLE GIRL AND THE BUTTERFLY</span>
</div>

<p>Some days Virginia pouts and is cross. She
does not go out to play. She cries for things her
mother does not want her to have. She will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
take a nap in her snug little bed. She cries for
candy, and will not eat her bread and butter.</p>

<p>One day Virginia was sitting on the door-step,
pouting; she had forgotten to be good that day.
Presently, a beautiful butterfly fluttered down
near her.</p>

<p>Virginia forgot all her naughty thoughts and
said, "Tell me, pretty Butterfly, where did you
come from and what made you so beautiful?"</p>

<p>The Butterfly turned its pretty head and looked
at Virginia a moment. Then it said, "Little girl,
I'll tell you a secret if you will forget your pouts
and listen."</p>

<p>Virginia promised.</p>

<p>"I was an egg once; for you know, little girl,
every living thing comes from an egg. This egg
hatched, and a little green worm crawled out.
This little green worm was I, and I did not
know then that some day I would be a beautiful
butterfly.</p>

<p>"I was a good little worm, and did all the things
Mother Nature told me to do. I ate the things
that were good for me. I liked nice, juicy leaves&mdash;and
Mother Nature told me they would make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
me grow big and strong. Little babies and little
calves have nice warm milk to make them grow,
and little worms eat nice, tender, green leaves.
I chewed them up fine, so that my very little
stomach could digest them. Do you like your
bread and butter?</p>

<p>"I do not cry for things Mother Nature tells me
are not good for me. Every day I take plenty of
cool, fresh water to drink from the drops I find
on the leaves. Little worms, as well as little girls,
need cool, pure water.</p>

<p>"You should see my bath-tub; it is a rose leaf
filled with dewdrops. Oh, how clean and sweet I
am after my daily bath! I am fresh and fit for
my travels over the green bushes and pretty rose
vines.</p>

<p>"Once I climbed to the top of a high maple
tree, and rested on a leaf, while I watched the
folks below passing.</p>

<p>"After I had eaten, and bathed, and played as
long as Mother Nature wanted me to, I curled up
in a tiny cradle and went fast asleep.</p>

<p>"My nap lasted a long time&mdash;all winter. All
babies need sleep, you know; it makes them grow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
healthy and strong. Mother Nature was wise;
she hung my cradle to the branch of a tree,
where it would be in the pure fresh air while I
was sleeping. The winds sang sweet lullabys to
me. Some fine days Jack Frost would go whistling
by. Sometimes an icicle would swing on
the same branch with me. When the warm sun
came out from behind the clouds, down would go
the little icicle to the ground, shattered and sparkling
like a thousand diamonds. All this time I
was tucked away in my warm, brown cradle,
waiting for the gentle spring breezes to wake me.</p>

<p>"One day I woke from my long nap to find that
I was a beautiful creature. Mother Nature had
dressed me in wonderful colors. My wings were
gaudy. She had given me graceful legs on which
to walk, and a pretty head and body. I could
fly from flower to flower. I did not eat leaves
any more, but I drank nectar from the flower
cups.</p>

<p>"I love the sunshine, the clear water, the
green grass, the bright flowers, and I love to
hear the birds sing in the trees. I love to see
the bees, as they rove from flower to flower to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
gather honey. Life seems one long, sweet song
as I flit here and there.</p>

<p>"Little girl, if you will listen to your mother
as I listened when Mother Nature told me how to
grow strong and beautiful, you will grow to be a
strong, healthy girl, with rosy cheeks and sparkling
eyes. To be strong and healthy is to be
beautiful."</p>

<h2>LITTLE BAREFOOT</h2>


<p>"Look out, little Barefoot, the hookworm will
catch you if you don't watch."</p>

<p>This is what Will seemed to hear a wee small
voice say one day as he stepped briskly along the
dewy path. Will was driving the cows to the
cool, green pasture down in the meadow.</p>

<p>Will always drove old Brindle and Bess to the
pasture every morning before he went to school.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Brindle and Bess loved the juicy grass in the
meadow pasture. They loved to drink the cool
brook water. They would stand knee-deep in it
on hot days. Soft pictures of the cows, and the
tall trees, and the clouds could be seen in its water.</p>

<p>When the sun was high in the sky, at noon-time,
old Brindle and Bess would lie down under
the trees near the brook, and chew and think,
and chew and think.</p>

<p>One afternoon Will came home from school
limping, and tired, and hot. His feet hurt him,
so he begged his mother not to send him for the
cows, but to let some one else bring Brindle and
Bess home at milking time.</p>

<p>Will's mother knew that something was surely
wrong, for Will liked nothing better than to call
faithful Rover and romp away to the pasture.
His mother looked at his feet and found them
blistered and very sore.</p>

<p>"We will call the doctor," she said.</p>

<p>Uncle John looked wise when he came to see
the little fellow.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! you have been going barefooted, my
little man, and some young hookworms that were in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the ground or grass have gone through the skin
on your feet and made your toes and feet sore."</p>

<p>"What are hookworms, Uncle?" asked Will.
Uncle John told him this:</p>

<p>"The hookworm is a very small worm, about
a quarter of an inch long, or a little more, when
it is grown. It was first brought to America
from Africa by the negroes&mdash;the slaves that the
Dutch people traded to our forefathers in the
colonial days.</p>

<p>"The little worm is called the 'American
Murderer,' because it kills so many people of the
southland. It does not hurt the little negro children
as badly as it does the white children.</p>

<p>"The hookworm eggs are hatched in the sand.
The young hookworm sheds its skin two or three
times, growing a little larger each time it sheds.</p>

<p>"Sometimes it will crawl upon a grass blade,
or lie in the sand until a little barefooted boy or
girl comes stepping along. (The worm is now so
small that it cannot be seen.) The little folks
step on the worm, and it pushes its way through
the skin. This is when it makes the sores on the
feet and between the toes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"As soon as the little hookworms get through
the skin they go into the blood. They are carried
to the heart and lungs by the veins. They go
from the lungs into the wind-pipe, and then crawl
from the wind-pipe into the gullet. It is then an
easy matter for them to get into the food tube in
the body.</p>

<p>"The mouth of the hookworm has a sharp
hook which it fastens into the wall of the food
tube. It hangs there and sucks all the blood it
wants. A hookworm will suck a drop of blood a
day. In feeding themselves they are slowly bleeding
the person, drop by drop. This is the reason
the boys or girls who have hookworms look so
pale, and feel so tired all the time. The hookworm
robs them of the good rich blood, and makes
children, and even grown persons, dull and lazy.
The disease keeps children from growing.</p>

<p>"It is easy to cure the disease, but it is better
to prevent it. We can prevent hookworm disease
by preventing the ground from being polluted.
Polluted ground means that which is made unclean
with waste matter from our bodies. The eggs are
found in this matter which pollutes the ground.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, Will, always wear your shoes, and see
that the soles are good and thick. Then, even
though the ground is unclean, hookworms can't
get to your feet. I am sure, now that you know
about hookworms, you will not go barefooted
through the lanes again."</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE FAIRIES</h2>


<p>Once there was a little girl who was very
beautiful. This little girl was a princess, and her
name was Hilda. Hilda had many servants in
her home to do her bidding. She had two little
servants to wait on her, and each of these little
servants had five other little servants. These
little servants were called hands and fingers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>She had two little servants to carry her everywhere
she wanted to go. These were called feet.
She had two little servants to see for her, called
eyes, two to hear for her, called ears; one to
talk for her, called tongue; and servants to chew
for her, called teeth.</p>

<p>Hilda took great pride in keeping these little
servants clean and sweet. But one day Hilda
grew cross. She would not keep her little hand-servants
clean, and they would not wash her little
eyes, or ears, or feet, and these other little servants
would not do their duty.</p>

<p>Soon her little teeth were dirty, for her hands
gathered all the germs they could find and carried
them to her pretty little mouth. Her little hand-servants
would not curl her hair, which got tangled
and ugly. The little teeth would not chew her
food well, so Hilda had a bad night with the
colic. In fact, her little servants treated Hilda
so badly that her mother was afraid some wicked
person had sent an evil spirit over them. I am
afraid that this was true, for Hilda was cross, and
sent that spell into her little servants.</p>

<p>Things went on this way for a whole day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
when Hilda's mother decided to carry her to
her Fairy Godmother, and see if she could do
anything to take this evil spirit from Hilda.</p>

<p>Hilda's Godmother was at home. The mother
told her about how things had been going. The
Godmother was very sad. After talking it all
over, she gave Hilda a large bundle to carry
home, and told her not to open it until she reached
the nursery. As soon as Hilda got to her own
clean little room, she started to untie the bundle.
She heard a tiny little voice, saying, "Hurry up,
little Hilda, we are waiting for you." As soon as
she unwrapped the first piece in the bundle, a pail
of nice warm water, with sponge, soap, and towel,
jumped out, and began washing her face and
hands. A toothbrush jumped out, and began washing
her teeth; a golden comb combed her pretty
curls; a little fairy jumped out and took off her
dirty dress and put a clean one on her; and
another small fairy laced up her shoes, and then
ran about, killing all the germs she could find.</p>

<p>When the fairies and all the other wonders
had finished their work, Hilda was again a beautiful
little girl, and more like a little princess than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
ever. The Fairy Godmother came into the room
and stooped and kissed her.</p>

<span class="caption">WHAT THE FAIRIES DID FOR LITTLE HILDA</span>
</div>

<p>Hilda, all of a sudden, opened her eyes and
saw her beautiful mother standing over her, kissing
her. Hilda rubbed her eyes and found that
she had been asleep.</p>

<p>"O, mother," she said, "I have been asleep,
and I had such a funny dream, and the fairies
were so nice to me." Hilda promised her mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
that she would never neglect her little servants
again. This made the mother very happy, and,
for making that promise, she bought Hilda a nice
new doll, dressed like a fairy.</p>

<p>Hilda was so proud of her doll that she named
her Fairy. Fairy has been very good to Hilda,
for every time she plays with her doll, Hilda
always makes sure that her face and hands are as
clean as her little doll's.</p>

<h2>THE RED CROSS SEAL</h2>


<p>I am only a tiny bit of paper, with a little
green and red color in the form of a cross or a
wreath. I am not much larger than a postage
stamp. I am going to tell you of some of the
work I have done for mankind in this big world,
notwithstanding my small size. Please don't think
I am boasting of myself in an unbecoming manner.
I was made long, long years ago, when our
grandfathers were just soldiers, and fighting each
other in a long and bloody war.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i-026.png" width="400" height="218" alt="Red Cross Seal" title="" />
</div>

<p>The mothers and wives of these soldiers were
constantly thinking out some plan by which they
could do something for the "boys" at the front.
It is hard to sit with idle hands when those we
love are in the thick of battle, and I sometimes
think that the women and children suffer most in
our great wars.</p>

<p>So, in 1862, when the days were very dark,
when the battle seemed so fierce, and when the
hospitals, North and South, were crowded with
the sick and wounded, some good ladies of Boston
thought of me. They decided to make me into a
stamp, and to sell me to get money to help the
sick soldiers. I was made and sold at a kind of
"post-office booth" at many fairs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>I did not look then just as I do now&mdash;you see
the style of my dress has changed with the change
in fashion. I have taken as my color the Red
Cross, the emblem of that great army of workers
who, in 1864, first organized the Red Cross
Society at Geneva, Switzerland. This society
works for the sick and suffering; it does not
matter under what flag they live.</p>

<p>Did you ever think of what a great thing a
flag is? Just a little bit of cotton with a few
colors on it, the red, white and blue, the tri-color
of France; the red, white and black, of Germany;
the stars and stripes of our own free land;
or the Red Cross of Greece on a white field, the
flag of the Red Cross Society.</p>

<p>Men have fought and died for the thing which
these bits of rag and color mean to them.</p>

<p>But I am getting away from my story. With
all the newness of the idea, and my very small
size, I helped to make nearly a million dollars
during that terrible war between our own beloved
States. This money was used for the benefit of
the sick and wounded soldiers.</p>

<p>My mission has always been one of mercy. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
cannot but feel good when I think over the days
of the past, and recall to memory the deeds I
have done.</p>

<p>For a long time after that war I had nothing
to do but to think of these past deeds, and, as I
thought of the poor fever-stricken soldiers to
whom I had brought medicine to cool their fever,
and how I had gotten bandages to bind the
wounds made by shot and shell, I thought sadly
that I was forgotten, and that my mission was
ended. These thoughts were sad, for I knew there
was a work to be done, and I wanted to be up
and about it. I wondered if the time would ever
come when I could go on another errand of mercy.
I felt that I must be needed somewhere in the big
world, but I hoped I would never see another war.</p>

<p>The time of waiting was a weary one, but one
day in 1892 I heard a call from little Portugal,
far across the ocean. I was needed by the Red
Cross there to aid in getting money for the sick
and suffering.</p>

<p>Since I answered that call I have been at work
in every country in the world; in coldest Russia,
in sunny Italy, and even in far-away Australia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes I work to provide money for soldiers,
for men will not stop fighting each other,
and the Red Cross owes allegiance to the sick and
wounded of every nation. Sometimes I work for
the benefit of the homeless ones; and, again, I
work for hospitals for sick children. My work is
broad, indeed.</p>

<p>I have always been happy in this work, for it
is a great one, but in the year 1907 I started the
work I like best of all.</p>

<p>It was that year that Miss Emily Bissell, a
little woman of Delaware, did what Jacob Riis
suggested. He suggested that Americans adopt
the plan already begun in Norway and Sweden.
This was to sell the Red Cross stamps to aid
in raising money for the great fight against
tuberculosis.</p>

<p>So the first real seal for this purpose was
issued in 1908, and since that time I have brought
to this cause over a million dollars. One little
seal, on which shines a red cross of Greece,
for one little penny, has grown and grown, until
with the seals and pennies I have made over a
million dollars to help suffering human beings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, let me tell you how it has been done.
I am printed about six weeks before Christmas.
After I am printed, with my red crosses and holly
wreaths, and "Merry Christmas," agents advertise
me in every nook and corner of the country.
I go to every little village&mdash;especially where there
are women interested in doing good for others.</p>

<p>I am sold to seal packages to go to far-away
countries; I am used to paste on the back of letters;
I go everywhere carrying the message of
"Peace and good will to men."</p>

<p>In every place that I go some one is talking
and writing about how to prevent tuberculosis,
the "great white plague," as Oliver Wendell
Holmes called it&mdash;the terrible disease that has
killed so many people&mdash;more than all the wars
of the world. Seventy-five to ninety per cent. of
all the money I bring is used in the community
in which I am sold.</p>

<p>The money I bring is used to hire nurses to go
down into the crowded city districts to care for
the poor consumptives crowded in the tenement
houses. It may help to send a poor little cripple,
with tuberculosis of the hip-joint, to the "Fresh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Air Home" in the mountains, where she has a
chance to get well. It often aids in sending a
tired, sick mother to the seashore in summer,
where she finds rest and health. It aids in sending
some one to the schools to teach the gospel
of fresh air, good food, and pure water for the
children.</p>

<p>So you see my mission has always been one of
mercy, hope and health. Yet I am such a little
thing&mdash;just a bit of paper, bearing a little red
cross on a white shield, worth only a penny.
"Great oaks from little acorns grow," you know.</p>

I have a sand bed, and there I play,<br />

And carry iron. When they return<br />

And now my sand bed is a farm.<br />
This is the barn. Here, safe from harm,<br />

<h2>THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT</h2>


<p>"Oh, Jack, Uncle John says, if we will build a
play-house for Mary and her dolls, he will take us
to Washington with him when he goes next
month."</p>

<p>"All right, Stuart, we can do it. Let us
begin right away. Here is a nice place for the
house, just on the little hill. The ground is nice
and sandy, and the rain-water runs off. Here
are some pretty trees for shade. The hill is not
high enough for it to be very cold.</p>

<p>"Now, for the house. We will place it so that
it will face the south. Then the living rooms will
have plenty of sunshine. We will put it about
two feet off the ground, in order that it will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
be damp; we can have a wide piazza nearly all
around the house; and on the south piazza we
can screen off a part for a sleeping porch. I am
sure the dolls would like one.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">THE SLEEPING PORCH THAT JACK BUILT</span>
</div>

<p>"We will screen every door and window to
keep the flies and mosquitoes out of the house.
Mary says that each room must have at least two
windows. She wants the walls of the rooms
painted a soft cream color. We will oil and wax
the floors. She can put a few rugs on them.
She does not want large ones that she cannot take
up when she sweeps.</p>

<p>"The little white iron beds, with dainty pillows
and white covers, will surely please the
dolls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Even in the parlor we will not have a single
chair with plush or velvet on it, for, Uncle John
says, such furniture collects and holds germs.
The plan for the kitchen is a beauty. Everything
is white except the stove. There is a nice little
table, and a cupboard, where the pans and dishes
are to be kept. The table is covered with zinc,
and the floor is covered with oil-cloth, so that it
will be easy to keep it clean. A shelf, on which
are fastened hooks for spoons and forks, is near
the sink.</p>

<p>"The windows will have white muslin sash
curtains. Mother says it is just the kitchen to
delight the heart of a neat little cook, with 'a
place for everything, and everything in its place.'</p>

<p>"Look at the cloth-covered broom we are
going to use for sweeping, no dust and no feather-dusters
in this play-house.</p>

<p>"We can put the well here, this is near the
house and on a hill above the barn and chicken
houses. We can put a little gasoline engine in,
to pump water into the bathroom and kitchen.</p>

<p>"We will plant some roses in the yard.</p>

<p>"Well, Stuart, we have worked hard on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Mary's doll-house, and, now that it is finished, I
am sure Uncle John will take us on the promised
trip."</p>

<p>"I showed the house to Uncle John to-day,
Jack, and he said he wished that some of the
'grown-ups' houses were as carefully planned for
sunshine and health as Mary's doll house."</p>

<p>A long while ago, so the story goes, there was
a time when the Lion, King of Beasts, had a little
mouse at his mercy. The Lion was about to crush
the mouse with his paw. The little mouse begged
for his life, and the great King of Beasts spared him.</p>

<p>Not a great while after that day the Lion was
caught in a net. He could not get out, and
howled with rage. The little mouse heard him,
and ran to help his old-time friend.</p>

<p>The great King of Beasts did not think the
little mouse could help him. But the mouse
gnawed the cords in the net with his teeth, and
thus set the Lion free.</p>

<p>This story that I am going to tell you is of a
rat&mdash;a kind of cousin to the mouse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>In many of our cities the City Fathers have not
thought much of the many rats that live in the
alleys and big warehouses, where cotton and
grain are stored.</p>

<p>The City Fathers, like the King of Beasts,
have looked with contempt on the little rats.
They did not believe they were large enough to
do any great harm, but rats and mice are dirty
little animals and can carry disease. The Health
Doctors, who are always digging into things, have
made a serious charge against Mr. Rat. They
say that he is the "Carrier" of a terrible disease,
and that he is to be more feared than the biggest
lion.</p>

<p>The rats have brought this disease from the
far-away countries in Asia. You will ask&mdash;How
could the rats bring this disease, which is called
"the plague," since they cannot swim across the
ocean? No, that is true. But you know that the
rats are great wanderers, and they frequently get
on the ships which are loaded in the harbors in
China, or Japan, and travel with the ships to the
next port. You must remember that rats have
fleas on them. In the far-away country the fleas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
bite persons who have the plague. The fleas then
get on the rats in the neighborhood, and even
give the plague to the rats.</p>

<p>When the ship unloads its cargo, in Mobile,
San Francisco, or New York, these rats, with their
fleas and plague germs, go ashore, and in this way
they spread the disease.</p>

<p>When the fleas from the rats bite persons, they
poison them with the plague germs. Many
persons in Asia die of this disease every year.</p>

<p>In this country we prevent it by doing what
the Lion of long ago did not do. We kill the rats,
for they are dirty little animals.</p>


<div class='center'>QUESTIONS</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Tell the story of the Lion and the Mouse. Who
wrote this fable? What is a fable?</p>

<p>2. Why are we not so merciful to the rat as the
Lion was?</p>

<p>3. What disease germs does the rat carry?</p></div>

<h2>FIRST AID TO THE INJURED AND THE
BOY SCOUTS</h2>


<p>"I say, Jack, what do you think; I am going
to join the Boy Scouts."</p>

<p>"What is that, Tom? I don't know anything
about Boy Scouts. Is it something new? You
are always starting some new stunt. Is it playing
soldier?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Jack; it is a company made up of
boys, who are learning to be manly and brave.
Being a Boy Scout takes you out-of-doors a great
deal, and in that way it helps make you strong
and healthy. I wish you would come with me
and join."</p>

<p>"Well, tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"The Boy Scouts were organized in England,
in 1907, and a brother organization was started
in America in 1910. It was started by men who
knew all about boys, and who wanted to help
them to get the best out of life.</p>

<p>"The Boy Scouts elect leaders; they form
troops, that is, so many boys under one leader.
They go camping. They go on long 'hikes.' A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
hike is a trip into the country, over hills and
through meadows.</p>

<p>"The Boy Scout must learn to swim, and to
do many things to help himself, and to help
others. A Boy Scout has to promise to do something
for some one each day&mdash;lend a helping hand.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brown, the lawyer, is our Scout Master.
Come, Jack, join us. You are twelve years old.
It will help to make a man of you. A number of
us are going to be initiated this afternoon; then
we will be Tenderfoot Scouts."</p>

<p>"All right, Tom, I'll ask mother. I am pretty
sure she will let me join. She wants me to be a
manly, healthy boy."</p>


<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Some Things Jack and Tom Learned To Do As Boy Scouts</span><br />

(<span class="smcap">first aid, it is called</span>)</div>

<p>When a person faints, lay him flat, loosen his
collar and belt, and bathe the face in cool water.</p>

<p>When a person is cut, and the wound is bleeding,
put a clean cloth on the wound, and press on
it with the fingers until it stops bleeding, or until
a doctor comes. Tie a bandage above the cut.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>If a bone is broken, carry the person so the
broken bone will not tear or injure the flesh near
it. Put a board or pillow under the broken bone
to steady it.</p>

<p>They also learn to bind wet soda to a burn.</p>

<p>To put clove oil or turpentine on a bit of
cotton in an aching tooth.</p>

<p>To put three drops of carbolic acid in half a
teaspoonful of warm glycerine into an aching ear.</p>

<p>To put wet cloths on the throat for sick
stomach.</p>

<p>To bathe a sprain in hot water, and not to
bandage until it stops swelling.</p>

<p>To turn an eyelid and take out a cinder, or a
bit of dirt, with a soft cloth.</p>

<p>When a person has taken poison, to give him
something to make him vomit&mdash;salt and warm
water, or mustard dissolved in warm water; call
for a doctor.</p>

<p>For sunstroke, to put the person in a cool place,
and bathe in cool water. To put ice-cap on head.</p>

<p>For heat prostration, to give stimulants, 10 to
12 drops of aromatic spirits of ammonia in a little
water, or hot drinks. Put hot-water bottle to the feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>When on fire, to lie down, not to run. Wrap
in a rug or blanket, or anything that will shut off
the air from the flame. To protect the face from
the flames.</p>

<p>In nose bleed, to raise the head and arms.
To press on the nostril from which the blood is
coming. That a small piece of cotton dipped in
very weak vinegar or lemon juice and placed in
the nostril will cause the bleeding to stop.</p>

<p>Should a child swallow a penny, or ring, or
other small things, to give bread and potatoes;
not to give a laxative, or purgative.</p>

<p>If a child has convulsions, to put it in a warm
bath without waiting to undress it.</p>

<p>For snake bite, or the bite of a dog, tie a
string above the bite, wash the wound with clean
water, and rub carbolic acid or luna caustic on it.</p>

<p>The most important thing that the Boy Scout
learns is that common sense and self-control are
two of the best things to possess.</p>

<p>The Boy Scout must be well trained to use
the last two aids for the benefit of the injured.</p>

<h2>A GREAT FIGHT</h2>


<p>Tom, Uncle John told me last night that he
was going to make a hard fight. I thought he
was going to war. He could not tell me all
about this fight then, because some one came for
him, to go to see a sick child.</p>

<p>When I went to bed, I dreamed Uncle John
was a soldier, and that he had on a uniform, and
was riding away on a big black horse. In my
dream, I could hear the bugle blow. Then I
dreamed he was fighting wild beasts. My! how
hot I got while I was dreaming this.</p>

<p>This morning, when I told Uncle John about
my dream, he said he was going to fight something
that did more harm than wild beasts. He
told me that, as soon as I helped mother, to come
over to his office, and he would tell me all about it.</p>

<p>I could scarcely eat my breakfast, I was in
such a hurry to learn what my Uncle John was
going to fight. I could just see him with a sword
buckled to his side, getting on a big war-horse,
galloping off to the music of fife and drum.</p>

<p>After breakfast, I ran to the office. "Well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
my boy," said Uncle John, "you have come to
learn about the big fight your peace-loving Uncle
is going to make. I am fighting for others, not
for myself, and I hope we will win this fight.</p>

<p>"I will show you the enemy, he is in ambush."
My eyes were wide open when Uncle said that.
Uncle John walked quickly over to a shelf and
took down a bottle of "Soothing Syrup." I wondered
what he was going to do, when he returned
and said, "This bottle holds one of the greatest
enemies of little innocent children. It contains
opium. Opium is a poison. Little babies don't
need it. Sometimes a mother will give too large a
dose, and kill her little one. The mother does not
know that the 'soothing' part of the syrup is opium.</p>

<p>"The English people have told the makers of
such stuff that they must take the opium out of it,
or label the bottle <i>poison</i>. Much of this kind of
medicine is sold. The people do not know how
harmful it is. I am going to fight this enemy of
little babies to the last ditch.</p>

<p>"Some of the well-known captains of regiments
of these fake cures are known as 'Compounds,'
'Bitters,' 'Kidney Cures,' 'Cough Cures,'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
'Asthma Cures' and 'Liver Regulators.' These
are mighty captains, and flaunt their false colors
in the daily newspapers which come to our firesides.
Many of them contain alcohol. 'Corn
Cures' and 'Skin Foods' are little corporals in
the army of the enemy.</p>

<p>"The great generals are the fake consumption
cures which are advertised in so many daily
papers and magazines. Their shot and shell are
the most dangerous, because they attack those
already weak. They rob persons of the judgment
to choose such allies as Fresh Air, Food and Rest.
They are not even brave soldiers&mdash;they strike the
weak and ignorant.</p>

<p>"<i>These</i>, my boy, are the enemies I am going
to fight&mdash;in the trenches and out. I am buckling
on my armor and sword. Will you join me,
and help to put down quacks and patent medicines
of all kinds?"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Give the names of some patent medicines you
